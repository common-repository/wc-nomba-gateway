To account for poor network connections, which can sometimes affect order status updates after a transaction, we __strongly__ recommend that you set a Webhook URL on your Nomba merchant dashboard. This way, whenever a transaction is complete on your store, we'll send a notification to the Webhook URL, which will update the order and mark it as paid. You can set this up by using the URL in red at the top of the Settings page. Just copy the URL and save it as your webhook URL on your Nomba dashboard under __Settings > Webhooks__ tab.

If you do not find Nomba on the Payment method options, please go through the settings again and ensure that:

*   You've checked the __"Enable/Disable"__ checkbox
*   You've entered your __API Keys__ in the appropriate field
*   Your store currency is set to __NGN__
*   You've clicked on __Save Changes__ during setup
